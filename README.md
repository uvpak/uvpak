# Unix Variant Package Manager

Welcome to Uvpak, the Unix Variant Package Manager!

Uvpak is a modern package manager for all Unix-like operating systems, built with Python!
A universal package manager for Linux, MacOS, BSD, WSL, Cygwin and more!

By default, Uvpak comes with NO pre installed package registries.  You must build and add
your own package registries that contain the software that YOU want to distribute and
install for your own systems and use cases.  This is YOUR package manager to distriute
YOUR artifacts the way YOU want to!

To get started, please refer to the Uvpak documentation at https://uvpak.mreschke.com
